# rpncalc

This RPN calc is based on
https://github.com/leonardo-s-dutra/RPNCalculator and modified 

* use QDialog as the container instead of QMainWindow so that it can
  be a modal popup in Candle

* shuffle the buttons and functions around to be suitable to CNC
  machine controls

*  Changes to feel more "HP" like.
